# ATHENA Project - Weekly Development Plan

## Project Overview
**Project ATHENA: Autonomous Telepresence for Hygienic Environmental Navigation & Assurance**

**Vision:** Deploy a fleet of commercially viable robots that autonomously maintain public washrooms to a superior standard of cleanliness and hygiene.

## Development Timeline Structure

This plan breaks down the 3-year strategic development into weekly sprints:

- **Year 1**: Foundation & MVP in Controlled Environment
  - Q1: Hardware Platform Finalization; Core Stack Integration
  - Q2: Single-Skill Reliability & Perception Bootstrapping
  - Q3: Integrated Task Execution & World Model Lite
  - Q4: MVP Pilot Deployment

- **Year 2**: Intelligence, Adaptation, and Scaling
  - Q1-Q2: Introduce Symbolic Reasoning & Learning-Based Skills
  - Q3-Q4: Fleet Learning & Robustness

- **Year 3**: Commercial Pilots, Validation, and Optimization
  - Q1-Q2: Large-Scale Beta Deployment
  - Q3-Q4: Productization & Launch Prep

## Key Principles
1. **Rumsfeld Matrix Approach**: Known Knowns (Doing), Known Unknowns (Measuring), Unknown Unknowns (Resilience), Unknown Knowns (Discovering)
2. **Determinism as a Tool**: Safety-critical stack must be deterministic, intelligence stack cannot be
3. **Data Engine as Product**: Closed-loop system of data collection → model improvement → deployment
4. **De-Risk Through Phasing**: Each phase builds on proven foundation of the last
