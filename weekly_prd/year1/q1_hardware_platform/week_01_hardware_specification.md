# Week 1 - Hardware Platform Specification & Design
**Dates:** January 1-7, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q1  
**Phase:** Hardware Platform Finalization; Core Stack Integration

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Complete hardware platform specification
- [ ] Finalize mobile base design requirements
- [ ] Define articulated arm specifications
- [ ] Establish compute platform requirements

## Key Deliverables
1. **Hardware Requirements Document** - Principal Architect - Jan 5
2. **Mobile Base Design Specification** - Senior Engineer - Jan 6
3. **Articulated Arm Specification** - Senior Engineer - Jan 7
4. **Compute Platform Selection** - Principal Architect - Jan 7

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Define overall system architecture requirements
- [ ] Specify compute platform (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin + MCU)
- [ ] Design safety-critical dual-rail architecture
- [ ] Create hardware integration strategy
- [ ] Define sensor suite requirements (Intel RealSense Depth Cameras)

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Design custom mobile base specifications
- [ ] Specify articulated arm requirements and kinematics
- [ ] Define motor and actuator specifications
- [ ] Create power management system design
- [ ] Specify communication protocols between components

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Research and document hardware component options
- [ ] Create component comparison matrices
- [ ] Document safety requirements and standards
- [ ] Assist with CAD modeling and design validation
- [ ] Create initial hardware testing protocols

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Mobile base design with articulated arm mounting - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Safety-critical MCU integration design - Principal Architect - High
- [ ] Power distribution system design - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Sensor mounting and calibration requirements - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] ROS 2 Humble compatibility verification - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Hardware abstraction layer design - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Safety system software architecture - Principal Architect - High

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Safety system testing procedures - Principal Architect - High

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Hardware component availability and lead times - Mitigation: Order critical components early, have backup suppliers
- **Medium Risk:** Integration complexity between custom and off-the-shelf components - Mitigation: Prototype integration early
- **Low Risk:** Power consumption exceeding specifications - Mitigation: Detailed power analysis and optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete hardware specification document approved
- [ ] All critical components identified and sourced
- [ ] Safety architecture validated through simulation
- [ ] Integration plan documented and reviewed

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** None (project start)
- **External:** Component supplier quotes and availability

## Notes & Comments
This week focuses on establishing the foundation for all hardware development. The dual-rail compute architecture (safety MCU + AI stack) is critical for commercial deployment safety requirements.
