# Week 2 - ROS 2 Humble Setup & Core Stack Integration
**Dates:** January 8-14, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q1  
**Phase:** Hardware Platform Finalization; Core Stack Integration

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Set up ROS 2 Humble development environment
- [ ] Integrate Nav2 navigation stack
- [ ] Integrate MoveIt 2 for arm control
- [ ] Set up ROS2 Control framework

## Key Deliverables
1. **ROS 2 Development Environment** - Associate Engineer - Jan 10
2. **Nav2 Integration** - Senior Engineer - Jan 12
3. **MoveIt 2 Configuration** - Senior Engineer - Jan 13
4. **ROS2 Control Setup** - Associate Engineer - Jan 14

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Define ROS 2 package architecture
- [ ] Design system-wide communication patterns
- [ ] Create integration testing framework
- [ ] Establish development workflow and standards
- [ ] Define parameter management strategy

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Integrate Nav2 with custom mobile base
- [ ] Configure MoveIt 2 for articulated arm
- [ ] Set up ROS2 Control for hardware abstraction
- [ ] Implement custom controllers for mobile base
- [ ] Create arm motion planning configuration

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Set up ROS 2 Humble development environment
- [ ] Create package structure and build system
- [ ] Implement basic launch files and configurations
- [ ] Set up debugging and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Create unit tests for core components

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] ROS 2 driver development for custom hardware - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Hardware abstraction layer implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Sensor driver integration (RealSense cameras) - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] Nav2 configuration for washroom environment - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] MoveIt 2 workspace and motion planning setup - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] ROS2 Control controller implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Parameter server configuration - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] ROS 2 system integration tests - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Navigation stack validation - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Arm control validation - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Performance benchmarking - Associate Engineer - Low

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** ROS 2 Humble compatibility with custom hardware - Mitigation: Early hardware-in-the-loop testing
- **Medium Risk:** MoveIt 2 configuration complexity - Mitigation: Use existing robot configurations as templates
- **Low Risk:** Performance issues with real-time control - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ROS 2 system boots and runs on target hardware
- [ ] Nav2 successfully plans paths in test environment
- [ ] MoveIt 2 executes basic arm movements
- [ ] ROS2 Control interfaces with hardware drivers

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Hardware specifications from Week 1
- **External:** ROS 2 Humble packages and documentation

## Notes & Comments
This week establishes the core software stack. The integration between Nav2, MoveIt 2, and ROS2 Control is critical for the robot's basic functionality. Focus on getting a working system rather than optimization.
