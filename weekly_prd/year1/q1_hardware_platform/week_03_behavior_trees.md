- [ ] Integrate behavior trees with Nav2 and MoveIt 2
- [ ] Set up behavior tree visualization and debugging

## Key Deliverables
1. **Behavior Tree Framework** - Senior Engineer - Jan 18
2. **Basic Task Behavior Trees** - Associate Engineer - Jan 19
3. **Integration with ROS 2 Stack** - Senior Engineer - Jan 20
4. **Visualization and Debugging Tools** - Associate Engineer - Jan 21

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Design behavior tree architecture for robot tasks
- [ ] Define task decomposition strategy
- [ ] Create behavior tree design patterns
- [ ] Establish error handling and recovery strategies
- [ ] Design supervisor-in-the-loop integration points

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Implement py_trees_ros integration framework
- [ ] Create behavior tree nodes for navigation tasks
- [ ] Implement behavior tree nodes for manipulation tasks
- [ ] Integrate behavior trees with ROS 2 services
- [ ] Implement behavior tree state management

### Associate Robotics Engineer

- [ ] Set up behavior tree visualization tools
- [ ] Create behavior tree testing framework

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Behavior tree hardware abstraction layer - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Safety system integration with behavior trees - Principal Architect - High
- [ ] Real-time behavior tree execution - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] py_trees_ros package integration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Custom behavior tree nodes for cleaning tasks - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Behavior tree persistence and state management - Associate Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Integration with Nav2 and MoveIt 2 services - Senior Engineer - High

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Integration tests with ROS 2 stack - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Behavior tree performance testing - Associate Engineer - Low
- [ ] Error handling and recovery testing - Senior Engineer - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Behavior tree complexity for real-world tasks - Mitigation: Start with simple tasks, iterate complexity
- **Medium Risk:** Integration with existing ROS 2 stack - Mitigation: Use well-defined interfaces and services
- **Low Risk:** Performance impact of behavior tree execution - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Behavior tree system executes basic navigation tasks
- [ ] Behavior tree system executes basic manipulation tasks
- [ ] Integration with Nav2 and MoveIt 2 is functional
- [ ] Behavior tree visualization and debugging tools work

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** ROS 2 setup from Week 2, Nav2 and MoveIt 2 integration
- **External:** py_trees_ros package and documentation

## Notes & Comments
Behavior trees provide the executive control for the robot. This week focuses on establishing the framework and basic functionality. The design should be extensible for more complex tasks in later quarters.
