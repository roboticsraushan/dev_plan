## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Simulation accuracy vs real-world performance - Mitigation: Validate with real hardware early
- **Medium Risk:** Gazebo performance with complex scenes - Mitigation: Optimize simulation parameters
- **Low Risk:** ROS 2 integration with Gazebo - Mitigation: Use well-tested integration packages

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Robot model accurately represents hardware specifications
- [ ] Simulation environment runs at real-time speed
- [ ] All ROS 2 components work in simulation
- [ ] Washroom environment is realistic and functional

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Hardware specifications from Week 1, ROS 2 setup from Week 2
- **External:** Ignition Gazebo installation and ROS 2 integration packages

## Notes & Comments
Simulation is critical for early testing and validation. The washroom environment should be as realistic as possible to catch integration issues before hardware deployment. Focus on getting a working simulation environment rather than perfect accuracy.
