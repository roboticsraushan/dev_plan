# Week 5 - System Integration Testing
**Dates:** January 29 - February 4, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q1  
**Phase:** Hardware Platform Finalization; Core Stack Integration

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Integrate all Q1 components (ROS 2, Nav2, MoveIt 2, Behavior Trees, Simulation)
- [ ] Perform end-to-end system testing
- [ ] Validate hardware-software integration
- [ ] Establish testing protocols and benchmarks

## Key Deliverables
1. **Integrated System Test Suite** - Senior Engineer - Feb 1
2. **Hardware-Software Integration Validation** - Senior Engineer - Feb 2
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Associate Engineer - Feb 3
4. **Q1 Integration Report** - Principal Architect - Feb 4

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Define integration testing strategy
- [ ] Create system performance benchmarks
- [ ] Establish quality gates and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review and approve integration results
- [ ] Plan Q2 transition strategy

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Integrate all Q1 components into working system
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Debug integration issues and performance problems
- [ ] Optimize system performance
- [ ] Create integration documentation

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Execute integration tests and document results
- [ ] Create performance measurement tools
- [ ] Assist with debugging and issue resolution
- [ ] Create test automation scripts
- [ ] Document testing procedures

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Full system hardware-software integration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Real-time performance validation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Safety system integration testing - Principal Architect - High
- [ ] Power consumption optimization - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] End-to-end behavior tree execution - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Navigation and manipulation coordination - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Error handling and recovery testing - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] System monitoring and logging - Associate Engineer - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Integration complexity causing system instability - Mitigation: Incremental integration with rollback capability
- **Medium Risk:** Performance issues in integrated system - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization throughout integration
- **Low Risk:** Test coverage gaps - Mitigation: Comprehensive test planning and review

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All Q1 components work together seamlessly
- [ ] System meets performance requirements
- [ ] Integration tests pass with >95% success rate
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** All Q1 components from previous weeks
- **External:** Hardware delivery and setup

## Notes & Comments
This week is critical for validating the Q1 foundation. Any integration issues discovered here will impact Q2 development. Focus on stability and performance over feature completeness.
