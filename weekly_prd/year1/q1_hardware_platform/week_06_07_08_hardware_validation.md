**Quarter:** Q1  
**Phase:** Hardware Platform Finalization; Core Stack Integration

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Complete hardware validation and testing
- [ ] Optimize system performance
- [ ] Prepare for Q2 perception bootstrapping
- [ ] Document Q1 achievements and lessons learned

## Key Deliverables
1. **Hardware Validation Report** - Senior Engineer - Feb 15
2. **Performance Optimization Results** - Senior Engineer - Feb 20
3. **Q1 Completion Documentation** - Principal Architect - Feb 22
4. **Q2 Transition Plan** - Principal Architect - Feb 25

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Review Q1 achievements against strategic goals
- [ ] Plan Q2 perception bootstrapping strategy
- [ ] Define success metrics for Q2
- [ ] Create risk mitigation strategies for Q2
- [ ] Establish data collection requirements for Q2

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Complete hardware validation testing
- [ ] Optimize system performance and reliability
- [ ] Implement final Q1 features and bug fixes
- [ ] Create Q2 perception system architecture
- [ ] Mentor associate engineers on Q2 preparation

### Associate Robotics Engineer

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Hardware performance not meeting specifications - Mitigation: Early identification and supplier engagement
- **Medium Risk:** Q2 preparation delays - Mitigation: Parallel Q2 preparation during Q1 validation
- **Low Risk:** Documentation gaps - Mitigation: Systematic documentation review

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Hardware platform meets all specifications
- [ ] System achieves target performance benchmarks
- [ ] Q1 objectives fully completed
- [ ] Q2 development environment ready

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** All Q1 components and integration
- **External:** Hardware supplier support and delivery

## Notes & Comments
These final weeks of Q1 focus on validation and preparation for Q2. The transition to perception bootstrapping requires a solid foundation from Q1. Any issues discovered here must be resolved before Q2 begins.
