## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Model accuracy not meeting mAP > 0.98 target - Mitigation: Extensive data augmentation and model architecture optimization
- **Medium Risk:** Real-time performance on edge hardware - Mitigation: Model quantization and optimization
- **Low Risk:** Dataset quality and diversity - Mitigation: Comprehensive data collection and validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Object detection models achieve mAP > 0.98
- [ ] Real-time inference runs at >10 FPS on target hardware
- [ ] Models detect all target objects reliably
- [ ] Model deployment integrates with ROS 2 stack

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Perception data collection from Week 9
- **External:** PyTorch, OpenCV, and computer vision libraries

## Notes & Comments
These weeks focus on developing the core perception capability. The mAP > 0.98 target is ambitious but necessary for reliable manipulation. Consider using pre-trained models and transfer learning to accelerate development.
