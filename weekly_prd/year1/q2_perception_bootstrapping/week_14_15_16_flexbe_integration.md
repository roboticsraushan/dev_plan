# Weeks 14-16 - FlexBE Integration & Q2 Completion
**Dates:** April 2-22, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q2  
**Phase:** Single-Skill Reliability & Perception Bootstrapping

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Integrate FlexBE for state execution visualization
- [ ] Complete Q2 perception and motion primitive development
- [ ] Achieve Q2 success criteria and metrics
- [ ] Prepare for Q3 integrated task execution

## Key Deliverables
1. **FlexBE Integration** - Senior Engineer - Apr 8
2. **Q2 System Integration** - Senior Engineer - Apr 15
3. **Q2 Performance Validation** - Associate Engineer - Apr 19
4. **Q3 Transition Plan** - Principal Architect - Apr 22

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Define Q2 completion criteria and validation
- [ ] Plan Q3 integrated task execution strategy
- [ ] Create Q2 to Q3 transition plan
- [ ] Establish Q3 success metrics and requirements
- [ ] Review and approve Q2 achievements

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Integrate FlexBE with behavior tree system
- [ ] Complete motion primitive development and optimization
- [ ] Integrate all Q2 components into working system
- [ ] Create Q3 development environment and tools
- [ ] Mentor associate engineers on Q3 preparation

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Implement FlexBE visualization and debugging tools
- [ ] Execute comprehensive Q2 testing and validation
- [ ] Create Q2 documentation and user guides
- [ ] Prepare Q3 development environment
- [ ] Assist with Q2 to Q3 transition

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] FlexBE integration with ROS 2 stack - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Complete Q2 hardware-software integration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance optimization and tuning - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Q3 hardware preparation and validation - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] FlexBE state machine implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Q2 system integration and testing - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Q3 development environment setup - Associate Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Documentation and code cleanup - Associate Engineer - Low

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Q2 comprehensive testing - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] User acceptance testing - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Q3 system readiness validation - Principal Architect - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Q2 objectives not met within timeline - Mitigation: Focus on core objectives, defer nice-to-have features
- **Medium Risk:** Q3 preparation delays - Mitigation: Parallel Q3 preparation during Q2 completion
- **Low Risk:** Integration issues between Q2 components - Mitigation: Incremental integration and testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Object detection mAP > 0.98 in target environments
- [ ] 100 successful consecutive executions of wipe_sink skill
- [ ] FlexBE provides effective state execution visualization
- [ ] Q2 system meets all performance requirements

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** All Q2 components from previous weeks
- **External:** FlexBE packages and documentation

## Notes & Comments
These final weeks of Q2 focus on integration and validation. The transition to Q3 requires a solid foundation of reliable perception and motion capabilities. Any issues discovered here must be resolved before Q3 begins.
