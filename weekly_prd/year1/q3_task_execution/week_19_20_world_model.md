# Weeks 19-20 - World Model Lite Implementation
**Dates:** May 7-20, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q3  
**Phase:** Integrated Task Execution & World Model Lite

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Implement simple state-based world model using Redis
- [ ] Integrate world model with task execution system
- [ ] Create world state monitoring and visualization
- [ ] Achieve Mean Time Between Interventions (MTBI) > 8 hours

## Key Deliverables
1. **World Model Architecture** - Principal Architect - May 10
2. **Redis-based State Management** - Senior Engineer - May 14
3. **World Model Integration** - Senior Engineer - May 17
4. **MTBI Validation** - Associate Engineer - May 20

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Design world model architecture and data structures
- [ ] Define state management and persistence strategies
- [ ] Create world model integration patterns
- [ ] Establish world model validation and testing criteria
- [ ] Plan fleet management integration strategy

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Implement Redis-based world model
- [ ] Create state management and persistence layer
- [ ] Integrate world model with task execution system
- [ ] Implement world state monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create world model debugging and visualization tools

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Set up Redis infrastructure and configuration
- [ ] Create world model testing and validation tools
- [ ] Implement world state visualization and monitoring
- [ ] Create world model documentation and examples
- [ ] Assist with integration testing and debugging

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Redis infrastructure setup and configuration - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] World model hardware integration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Real-time state management optimization - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Performance optimization for state operations - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] World model implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] State management and persistence - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] World model integration with task execution - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] State monitoring and visualization - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] World model unit testing - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Integration testing with task execution - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] MTBI validation and testing - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance and reliability validation - Senior Engineer - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** World model complexity and state consistency - Mitigation: Simple state model with clear consistency rules
- **Medium Risk:** Redis performance and scalability - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization
- **Low Risk:** Integration issues with task execution - Mitigation: Well-defined interfaces and incremental integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] World model maintains consistent state across task execution
- [ ] MTBI > 8 hours achieved
- [ ] World model integrates seamlessly with task execution system
- [ ] State monitoring and visualization work effectively

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Task execution system from Weeks 17-18
- **External:** Redis infrastructure and state management libraries

## Notes & Comments
The world model provides the foundation for more complex behaviors in Q4 and Year 2. Focus on simplicity and reliability over complexity. The MTBI target is critical for commercial viability.
