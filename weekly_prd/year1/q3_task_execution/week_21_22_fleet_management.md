- [ ] Create fleet management infrastructure
- [ ] Integrate fleet management with world model
- [ ] Prepare for Q4 MVP pilot deployment

## Key Deliverables
1. **K3s Robot Setup** - Senior Engineer - May 24
2. **Fleet Management System** - Senior Engineer - May 28
3. **Fleet-World Model Integration** - Senior Engineer - May 31
4. **Q4 Pilot Preparation** - Principal Architect - June 3

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Design fleet management architecture
- [ ] Define fleet coordination and communication strategies

- [ ] Implement fleet monitoring and visualization
- [ ] Create fleet management documentation and examples
- [ ] Assist with Q4 pilot preparation

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] K3s hardware integration and optimization - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Fleet communication infrastructure - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Fleet management hardware validation - Associate Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Performance optimization for fleet operations - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] K3s implementation and configuration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Fleet management system development - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Fleet-world model integration - Senior Engineer - High

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** K3s performance on robot hardware - Mitigation: Lightweight configuration and optimization
- **Medium Risk:** Fleet management complexity - Mitigation: Simple fleet model with clear responsibilities
- **Low Risk:** Integration issues with world model - Mitigation: Well-defined interfaces and incremental integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] K3s runs efficiently on robot hardware
- [ ] Fleet management system coordinates multiple robots
- [ ] Fleet management integrates with world model
- [ ] System is ready for Q4 pilot deployment

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** World model from Weeks 19-20, task execution system
- **External:** K3s infrastructure and fleet management libraries

## Notes & Comments
Fleet management provides the foundation for scaling to multiple robots in Year 2. Focus on simplicity and reliability over advanced features. The Q4 pilot preparation is critical for validating the system in real-world conditions.
