# Weeks 23-24 - Q3 Completion & Q4 Preparation
**Dates:** June 4-17, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q3  
**Phase:** Integrated Task Execution & World Model Lite

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Complete Q3 integrated task execution development
- [ ] Achieve Q3 success criteria and metrics
- [ ] Prepare for Q4 MVP pilot deployment
- [ ] Document Q3 achievements and lessons learned

## Key Deliverables
1. **Q3 System Integration** - Senior Engineer - Jun 7
2. **Q3 Performance Validation** - Associate Engineer - Jun 11
3. **Q4 Pilot Preparation** - Principal Architect - Jun 14
4. **Q3 Completion Documentation** - Principal Architect - Jun 17

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Review Q3 achievements against strategic goals
- [ ] Plan Q4 MVP pilot deployment strategy
- [ ] Define Q4 success metrics and requirements
- [ ] Create Q4 risk mitigation strategies
- [ ] Establish Q4 pilot site requirements and criteria

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Complete Q3 system integration and optimization
- [ ] Implement final Q3 features and bug fixes
- [ ] Create Q4 pilot deployment tools and procedures
- [ ] Mentor associate engineers on Q4 preparation
- [ ] Optimize system performance for pilot deployment

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Execute comprehensive Q3 testing and validation
- [ ] Create Q3 documentation and user guides
- [ ] Prepare Q4 pilot deployment environment
- [ ] Assist with Q4 pilot site preparation
- [ ] Create Q4 pilot monitoring and logging tools

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Complete Q3 hardware-software integration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance optimization and tuning - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Q4 pilot hardware preparation - Associate Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Safety system validation for pilot deployment - Principal Architect - High

### Software Development
- [ ] Final Q3 software optimizations - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Q4 pilot deployment tools - Senior Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Q4 pilot monitoring and logging - Associate Engineer - Medium
- [ ] Documentation and code cleanup - Associate Engineer - Low

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Q3 comprehensive testing - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Q4 pilot readiness validation - Principal Architect - High
- [ ] User acceptance testing - Senior Engineer - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Q3 objectives not met within timeline - Mitigation: Focus on core objectives, defer nice-to-have features
- **Medium Risk:** Q4 pilot preparation delays - Mitigation: Parallel Q4 preparation during Q3 completion
- **Low Risk:** Integration issues between Q3 components - Mitigation: Incremental integration and testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Full clean of one washroom stall without intervention, 10 times consecutively
- [ ] Mean Time Between Interventions (MTBI) > 8 hours
- [ ] Q3 system meets all performance requirements
- [ ] Q4 pilot deployment is ready

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** All Q3 components from previous weeks
- **External:** Q4 pilot site preparation and approval

## Notes & Comments
These final weeks of Q3 focus on completion and preparation for the critical Q4 pilot deployment. The pilot deployment will validate the system in real-world conditions and is essential for Year 2 development. Any issues discovered here must be resolved before Q4 begins.
