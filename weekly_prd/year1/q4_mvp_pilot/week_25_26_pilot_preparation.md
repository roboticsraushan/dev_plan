- [ ] Deploy robot system to pilot site
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection and recovery behaviors
- [ ] Set up supervisor-in-the-loop monitoring

## Key Deliverables
1. **Pilot Site Setup** - Associate Engineer - Jun 21
2. **Robot Deployment** - Senior Engineer - Jun 25
3. **Anomaly Detection System** - Senior Engineer - Jun 28
4. **Supervisor Monitoring** - Principal Architect - Jul 1

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Define pilot deployment strategy and requirements
- [ ] Create anomaly detection and recovery strategies
- [ ] Establish supervisor-in-the-loop protocols
- [ ] Plan pilot success criteria and validation
- [ ] Create pilot risk mitigation strategies

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Deploy robot system to pilot site
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection system (Isolation Forest / SVM)
- [ ] Create recovery behaviors in behavior trees
- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement pilot-specific optimizations

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Prepare pilot site infrastructure
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging systems
- [ ] Create pilot deployment documentation
- [ ] Assist with system deployment and testing
- [ ] Create pilot monitoring and visualization tools

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Pilot site hardware setup and validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Robot deployment and configuration - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Real-time monitoring system setup - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Safety system validation for pilot site - Principal Architect - High

### Software Development
- [ ] Anomaly detection implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Recovery behavior implementation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Supervisor monitoring interface - Principal Architect - High
- [ ] Pilot-specific system optimizations - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Pilot site system validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Anomaly detection testing - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Recovery behavior testing - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Supervisor monitoring testing - Principal Architect - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Pilot site deployment issues - Mitigation: Extensive pre-deployment testing and validation
- **Medium Risk:** Anomaly detection false positives/negatives - Mitigation: Careful tuning and validation
- **Low Risk:** Supervisor monitoring system reliability - Mitigation: Redundant monitoring and fallback systems

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Robot successfully deployed to pilot site
- [ ] Anomaly detection system operational
- [ ] Recovery behaviors work effectively
- [ ] Supervisor monitoring system functional

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Q3 integrated task execution system
- **External:** Pilot site approval and access

## Notes & Comments
The pilot deployment is critical for validating the system in real-world conditions. Focus on reliability and monitoring over advanced features. The supervisor-in-the-loop model is essential for handling unknown unknowns.
