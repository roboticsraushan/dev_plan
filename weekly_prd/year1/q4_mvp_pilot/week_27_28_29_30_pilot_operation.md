# Weeks 27-30 - Pilot Operation & Validation
**Dates:** July 2-29, 2024  
**Quarter:** Q4  
**Phase:** MVP Pilot Deployment

## Sprint Objectives
- [ ] Operate robot system in pilot environment
- [ ] Achieve 1-week continuous operation with < 5 remote interventions per 24h
- [ ] Collect operational data and performance metrics
- [ ] Validate system for Year 2 development

## Key Deliverables
1. **Pilot Operation System** - Senior Engineer - Jul 5
2. **Performance Metrics Collection** - Associate Engineer - Jul 12
3. **Pilot Validation Report** - Principal Architect - Jul 19
4. **Year 2 Preparation** - Principal Architect - Jul 29

## Role Assignments

### Principal Robotics Architect
- [ ] Monitor pilot operation and performance
- [ ] Analyze operational data and metrics
- [ ] Create pilot validation report and recommendations
- [ ] Plan Year 2 development strategy
- [ ] Establish Year 2 success criteria and requirements

### Senior Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Operate and maintain robot system during pilot
- [ ] Monitor system performance and reliability
- [ ] Implement pilot-specific optimizations and fixes
- [ ] Collect and analyze operational data
- [ ] Prepare system for Year 2 development

### Associate Robotics Engineer
- [ ] Monitor pilot operation and collect data
- [ ] Create pilot operation documentation
- [ ] Assist with system maintenance and troubleshooting
- [ ] Create pilot performance reports
- [ ] Prepare Year 2 development environment

## Technical Tasks

### Hardware & Integration
- [ ] Pilot operation hardware monitoring - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] System maintenance and optimization - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance data collection - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Year 2 hardware preparation - Associate Engineer - Medium

### Software Development
- [ ] Pilot operation software monitoring - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance optimization and tuning - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Data collection and analysis tools - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Year 2 software preparation - Senior Engineer - Medium

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Pilot operation validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] Performance metrics validation - Associate Engineer - High
- [ ] System reliability validation - Senior Engineer - High
- [ ] Year 2 readiness validation - Principal Architect - Medium

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Pilot operation failures or performance issues - Mitigation: Continuous monitoring and rapid response
- **Medium Risk:** Data collection and analysis gaps - Mitigation: Comprehensive data collection and validation
- **Low Risk:** Year 2 preparation delays - Mitigation: Parallel Year 2 preparation during pilot operation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 1-week continuous operation in live commercial washroom
- [ ] < 5 remote interventions per 24h
- [ ] Comprehensive operational data collected
- [ ] System validated for Year 2 development

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Q4 pilot deployment from Weeks 25-26
- **External:** Pilot site cooperation and data access

## Notes & Comments
The pilot operation is critical for validating the system in real-world conditions. The < 5 interventions per 24h target is ambitious but necessary for commercial viability. Focus on data collection and analysis for Year 2 development.
