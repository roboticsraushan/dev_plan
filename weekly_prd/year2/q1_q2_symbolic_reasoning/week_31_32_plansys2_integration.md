## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** PlanSys2 complexity and integration issues - Mitigation: Incremental integration and extensive testing
- **Medium Risk:** PDDL domain complexity for real-world tasks - Mitigation: Start with simple domain, iterate complexity
- **Low Risk:** Performance issues with symbolic reasoning - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] PlanSys2 successfully integrated with ROS 2 stack
- [ ] PDDL domain accurately represents cleaning tasks
- [ ] Symbolic reasoning framework operational
- [ ] Planner-behavior tree integration functional

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Year 1 integrated task execution system
- **External:** PlanSys2 packages and PDDL libraries

## Notes & Comments
PlanSys2 provides symbolic reasoning capabilities as a fallback to behavior trees. The PDDL domain should be simple initially and expanded based on real-world experience. Focus on integration and basic functionality over advanced features.
