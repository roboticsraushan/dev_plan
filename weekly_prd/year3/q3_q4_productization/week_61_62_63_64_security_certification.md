## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Security audit findings and compliance issues - Mitigation: Early security implementation and validation
- **Medium Risk:** SOC 2 compliance complexity - Mitigation: Careful implementation and validation
- **Low Risk:** Safety standards certification delays - Mitigation: Early certification process initiation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical findings
- [ ] SOC 2 compliance achieved
- [ ] Safety standards certification process initiated
- [ ] Security measures implemented and operational

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Year 3 productization and Hardware v2
- **External:** Security audit firms and certification bodies

## Notes & Comments
Security and certification are critical for commercial deployment. The SOC 2 compliance is essential for enterprise customers. Focus on security and compliance over advanced features.
